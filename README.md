# ðŸ§  AI-Powered Dyslexia Detection & Learning Aid

This project is an end-to-end solution that helps detect signs of dyslexia using machine learning and supports users through interactive learning aids. The detection system uses NLP techniques and a Random Forest model trained on student assessment data to identify patterns associated with dyslexia. The learning module, built with ReactJS, offers personalized games and exercises targeting key cognitive skills like visual discrimination, memory, and letter recognition to support users in overcoming challenges associated with dyslexia.
